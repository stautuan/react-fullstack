        I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic
        container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat
        through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic.
        So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something
        green, huh? How are you even alive?{" "}

        That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus
        there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We
        made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business
        together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your
        hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds
        a week, thirty-five thousand a pound.{" "}

        Look... I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but
        once more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin
        our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can
        cook. Failing that, we're dead. There's no more room for error. Not with
        these people.{" "}
